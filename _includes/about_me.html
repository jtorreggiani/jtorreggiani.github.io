          As an undergraduate studying history and philosophy, I was inspired by the struggles and triumphs of humankind. Studying environmental ethics impressed upon me the severity of the environmental degradation and  suffering happening in the world. I realized how far humanity has come and how far it still needs to go. I became dedicated to making a positive difference any way I could.

          After graduating in 2010, I enrolled in a masters in political science to study environmental policy. I quickly realized in order to understand the complex problems facing the world, I needed to pursue interdisciplinary research. This led me to leave the program and begin a period of intensive self-directed learning and further education in the STEM fields. That singular pursuit eventually led me to software development and to become a technical contributor to impact-driven organizations across multiple domains.
